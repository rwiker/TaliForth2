"""Talitest spawns a copy of py65mon running Tali Forth 2 and
feeds it tests, saving the results.  This script requires pexpect
(available via pip) and needs to run on a linux system.  The windows
version of py65mon reads directly from the console rather than
stdin, and therefore doesn't work with pexpect on Windows (even
though pexpect is now supported on Windows).

RUNNING     : Run talitest.py from the tests directory.

This script takes a long time to run (25 minutes on my system).
Results will be found in results.txt when finished.  Grep for
"Undefined" to find words it couldn't run (some of these will be
from a previous failed compilation).  Grep for "RESULT" to find
WRONG NUMBER OF RESULTS errors and INCORRECT RESULTS errors.  Note
that the original error messages show up first.
