# Documentation for Tali Forth 2 
Scot W. Stevenson <scot.stevenson@gmail.com>

Tali Forth's documentation is written in AsciiDoc and compiled to a main HTML
file with `asciidoctor -a toc=left manual.adoc`. In future versions, there will
be a PDF document.

This folder looks messier than it is -- what you are probably looking for are
the `manual.html` and possibly the `WORDLIST.md` files. The last two files in the
folder are generated by the Ophis assembler and contain the listing and symbols
used.

The `TODO.txt` list is not always up to date, see the list of issues on the
GitHub home of Tali Forth 2.
