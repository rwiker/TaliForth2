# Documentation for Tali Forth 2 
Scot W. Stevenson <scot.stevenson@gmail.com>

This folder looks messier than it is -- what you are probably looking for are
the `manual.pdf` and possibly the `WORDLIST.md` files. The last two files in the
folder are generated by the Ophis assembler and contain the listing and symbols
used. Most of the other stuff just belongs to the LaTeX tool chain.

The `TODO.txt` list is not always up to date, see the list of issues on the
GitHub home of Tali Forth 2.
