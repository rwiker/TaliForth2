\ List of high-level Forth words for Tali Forth 2 for the 65c02
\ Scot W. Stevenson <scot.stevenson@gmail.com>
\ This version: 22. Sep 2018

\ When changing these words, edit them here and then use the 
\ forth_to_dotbyte.py tool to convert them to the required format
\ for inclusion in Ophis. See forth_words/README.md for details

\ Output and comment. Because it still blows my mind that we can
\ define this stuff this simply 
        : ( [char] ) parse 2drop ; immediate
        : .( [char] ) parse type ; immediate

\ Flow control. Some of these could be realized with CS-ROLL and
\ CS-PICK instead, which seems to be all the rage these days.
        : if postpone 0branch here 0 , ; immediate compile-only
        : then here swap ! ; immediate compile-only
        : else postpone branch here 0 , here rot ! ; immediate compile-only
        : repeat postpone again here swap ! ; immediate compile-only
        : until postpone 0branch , ; immediate compile-only
        : while postpone 0branch here 0 , swap ; immediate compile-only
        : case 0 ; immediate compile-only 
        : of postpone over postpone = postpone if postpone drop ; immediate compile-only 
        : endof postpone else ; immediate compile-only 
        : endcase postpone drop begin ?dup while postpone then repeat ; immediate compile-only 

\ DEFER and friends. Code taken from ANS Forth specification. Some of
\ these will be moved to assembler code in due course
        : defer! >body ! ;
        : defer@ >body @ ;
        : is state @ if postpone ['] postpone defer! else ' defer! then ; immediate
        : action-of state @ if postpone ['] postpone defer@ else ' defer@ then ; immediate

\ Output definitions. Since these usually involve the user, and humans
\ are slow, these can stay high-level for the moment. However, in this
\ state they don't check for underflow. Based on
\ https://github.com/philburk/pforth/blob/master/fth/numberio.fth
        : u.r >r 0 <# #s #> r> over - spaces type ;
        : .r >r dup abs 0 <# #s rot sign #> r> over - spaces type ;
        : ud. <# #s #> type space ;
        : ud.r >r <# #s #> r> over - spaces type ;
        : d. tuck dabs <# #s rot sign #> type space ;
        : d.r >r tuck dabs <# #s rot sign #> r> over - spaces type ;

\ Temporary high-level words. TODO convert these to assembler
        : 2constant ( d -- ) create swap , , does> dup @ swap cell+ @ ;
        : 2literal ( d -- ) swap postpone literal postpone literal ; immediate

\ Splash strings. We leave these as high-level words because they are
\ generated at the end of the boot process and signal that the other
\ high-level definitions worked (or at least didn't crash)
